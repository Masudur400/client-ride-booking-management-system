# Driver/Rider Booking System üöóüõµ

## üåü Project Overview
The **Driver/Rider Booking System** is a modern, full-stack web application built to manage ride bookings efficiently. It provides a seamless platform for users to apply for driver or rider roles, create ride posts, book rides, and manage bookings. The system is designed to be user-friendly and role-based, giving Admins full control over posts, applications, and users.

This project is ideal for anyone looking to implement a simple yet functional ride management platform, similar to ride-sharing services like Uber or Pathao, but lightweight and fully customizable.
